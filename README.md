# TEST RUFIER
This program (written in python using the PyQt5 library) will allow you to conduct an initial diagnosis of your health using the Rufier test.

Rufier's test is a loading complex designed to assess the heart's performance during physical exertion.

In a person lying on his back for 5 minutes, the pulse rate is determined in 15 seconds; then within 45 seconds the person performs 30 squats.

At the end of the exercise, the person lies down, and the number of pulsations is counted again for the first 15 seconds, and then for the last 15 seconds of the first minute of the recovery period.
